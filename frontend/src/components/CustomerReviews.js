const review1 = `# Amazing experience

_March 1, 2022 by [Olivier](https://twitter.com/olivier)_

I stared using BookMe a few months ago and I still cannot believe that booking hairdresser's
service can be so easy. Game changer!

## What makes a difference

Bookme stand out from the competition thanks to its simple, user-friendly interface that makes
booking a hair appointment quick and easy. With just a few clicks, you can book an appointment
at the hair salon of your choice.

Plus, you can see real-time availability and book immediately.
Gone are the days of waiting on the phone or scrambling to find an open appointment!

### **Design**

I really appreciate the way BookMe is designed. Details that caught my attention:

- Custom, calm color palette. Such a composition... It's rare, but great!
- Styling of components with smooth shadows around them.

Why you should start using BookMe?

1. Hairdressers offers are much cheaper than on other platforms.
2. BookMe offers more features than its competitors.
3. Have you seen how fast it is growing? In two years everybody will be using BookMe.

Don't hesitate any longer. Book a hairdresser's service on BookMe and become the part of rapidly
growing BookMe family.

I really like the way that BookMe makes it easy to find the right hairdresser for me.
I can search by name, city, address, and the recommendations are always spot on.

Plus, the app makes it easy to keep track of what I booked. One token and everything is clear.
I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to feel great about his hair!

BookMe just released some great new features! I think, new goal is to make it the best online
booking platform for businesses and individuals alike. With new easy-to-use interface,
I can now manage my bookings and appointments with greater efficiency and convenience than ever before.

- Token to confirm my reservation, oh great!
- Just 3 clicks and service is booked. I'm stunned.

Plus, new pricing rules imposed on hairdressers make BookMe even more affordable for customers!
